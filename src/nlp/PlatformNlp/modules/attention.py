  """Performs multi-headed attention from `from_tensor` to `to_tensor`.

  This is an implementation of multi-headed attention based on "Attention
  is all you Need". If `from_tensor` and `to_tensor` are the same, then
  this is self-attention. Each timestep in `from_tensor` attends to the
  corresponding sequence in `to_tensor`, and returns a fixed-with vector.

  This function first projects `from_tensor` into a "query" tensor and
  `to_tensor` into "key" and "value" tensors. These are (effectively) a list
  of tensors of length `num_attention_heads`, where each tensor is of shape
  [batch_size, seq_length, size_per_head].

  Then, the query and key tensors are dot-producted and scaled. These are
  softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The value tensors are then
  interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single
  tensor and returned.

  In practice, the multi-headed attention are done with transposes and
  reshapes rather than actual separate tensors.

  Args:
    from_tensor: float Tensor of shape [batch_size, from_seq_length,
      from_width].
    to_tensor: float Tensor of shape [batch_size, to_seq_length, to_width].
    attention_mask: (optional) int32 Tensor of shape [batch_size,
      from_seq_length, to_seq_length]. The values should be 1 or 0. The
      attention scores will effectively be set to -infinity for any positions in
      the mask that are 0, and will be unchanged for positions that are 1.
    num_attention_heads: int. Number of attention heads.
    size_per_head: int. Size of each attention head.
    query_act: (optional) Activation function for the query transform.
    key_act: (optional) Activation function for the key transform.
    value_act: (optional) Activation function for the value transform.
    attention_probs_dropout_prob: (optional) float. Dropout probability of the
      attention probabilities.
    initializer_range: float. Range of the weight initializer.
    do_return_2d_tensor: bool. If True, the output will be of shape [batch_size
      * from_seq_length, num_attention_heads * size_per_head]. If False, the
      output will be of shape [batch_size, from_seq_length, num_attention_heads
      * size_per_head].
    batch_size: (Optional) int. If the input is 2D, this might be the batch size
      of the 3D version of the `from_tensor` and `to_tensor`.
    from_seq_length: (Optional) If the input is 2D, this might be the seq length
      of the 3D version of the `from_tensor`.
    to_seq_length: (Optional) If the input is 2D, this might be the seq length
      of the 3D version of the `to_tensor`.

  Returns:
    float Tensor of shape [batch_size, from_seq_length,
      num_attention_heads * size_per_head]. (If `do_return_2d_tensor` is
      true, this will be of shape [batch_size * from_seq_length,
      num_attention_heads * size_per_head]).
